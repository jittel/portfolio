                    <p>Learn when to stop. In life you need colors. Everyone is going to see things differently - and <br /> that's the way it should be. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you <br /> happy then it's good. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Nice little fluffy clouds <br /> laying around in the sky being lazy.

                        There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy <br /> and doesn't hurt anyone. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. <br /> Let's have a nice tree right here.

                        I get carried away with this brush cleaning. You can create <br /> the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Without washing the brush, <br /> I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. <br /> We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. We want to use a lot pressure while using no <br /> pressure at all. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.

                        All you <br /> need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. That's what makes life fun. That you can <br /> make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Now then, let's play.

                        And <br /> right there you got an almighty cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. You can do <br /> anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.

                        No pressure. Just relax and <br /> watch it happen. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are <br /> to you. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. I can't think of anything <br /> more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. We'll play with <br /> clouds today.

                        Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. This is the fun part I guess <br /> that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Very easy to work these to death. <br /> There are no limits in this world. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.
